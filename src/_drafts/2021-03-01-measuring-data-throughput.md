For a network node, the **data throughput** can be in **downstream** or in **upstream**. It is expressed in bits per second **bps** or in byte (8 bits) per second **Bps**.
In other words, it is respectively a download speed and a upload speed between 2 nodes of a network.


file size of an uncompressed raster image file,
number of pixels in the image and the bit depth of each pixel.
Each pixel in a raster image typically takes up about 1 to 8 bits for black-and-white images and 8 to 64 bits for colored images.

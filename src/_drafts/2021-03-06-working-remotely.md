I work since March 2020 until now totally remotely due to the Covid-19 pandemic in Europa.
During this particular year, I have accumulated experience with this method of work. It is time for me to share it.
Of course here, the situation is extreme, it is not simply a remote work, mainly for 2 reasons, 
remote work is not a synonym to work alone at home and not every full workday. My experience is only 
a **kind of remote work among different patterns**. Not the best one because it is under a external 
constraint and not fully wished, but enough rich in teachings to be very interesting to share. 
I am going to share you my experience through the situation that I live and a compilation of resources 
that I read during this year to organize my **Working-From-Home** (WFH) and understand better the stakes of the remote work.

# What is the remote work?

Remote work is a working style that allows professionals to work outside of a traditional office environment. 
It is based on the concept that work does not need to be done in a specific place to be executed successfully.
My analysis of different shapes of the remote work has 4 dimensions:

* **Proportion**: It is the proportion of remote work time by work time (part-time, full-time remote work).
* **Contract**: Are you self-employed, employer or employee? Is the remote work for the same company, different companies? 
* **Location**: Are you always at the same location or nomad, close or away of your company office or other workers?
* **Structure**: Has the company at least one physical office? Is it a mature or startup company? Is it a worldwide, national or local company?

I could add another dimension the **frequency** to know if the remote work is permanent or occasional. With these dimensions, you can classify
the remote work with different patterns. Famous patterns are:

* **Full-time remote worker**: He is defined as a full-time employee of a company who works from home or at proximity.
* **Digital-nomad worker**: He will work for one or several company through a round-trip around the world where 
  you move out regularly.
* **Moonlight remote worker**: He will work a traditional full-time job and then complete remote work when 
he has free time at home.
* **Diversified remote worker**: He is someone who works part-time for an on-site position and part-time as a remote worker. 
* **Remote independent/business owner**: He will occupy a function like traditional business owners except they work remotely
  and hire remote employees. And or also known as freelancers, he will work on a project-to-project basis for various companies.
  
So the first thing is to identify what is your remote work pattern. For my part, It is the **full-time remote worker**. Of course each pattern has variants,
more precisely, in my case, it is permanent and exclusively with Work-From-Home, and in a world-wide mature company, but where I live close to
the physical Paris office, and close to my other co-workers.

# The remote work is not for everyone

The remote work is not necessary adapted for all activity sectors, I focus here on what I
know, I will speak only for the tech sector and more precisely for the job of **software engineer at large for your 
R&D department**. So I am not going to speak here about the customer and business relationship between company that applies a 
full or partial remote program for all or only a part of employees, and its customers or investors. 
It are other problematics very interesting but with their specificities.

The telework is not an improvisation or just a fun work methodology, it requires **auto-discipline**, **professional 
maturity**, and **autonomy**. For a **starter** or a **junior** in a company, it is certainly not the best way to work, and it requires
a additional effort to overcome it. The good candidates to work remotely are **experienced employees** that have already a 
some experience of the company. In my case, I was an experienced worker in my company since several years, so the remote work should be easier 
for me, I know really well my job, the culture of the company. But I went out just of an internal mobility from Software Reliability Engineer 
(SRE) to Software Development Engineer (SDE) with new missions and a new pool of interactions. I was between the difficulty to understand
my new role, and to do my own on-boarding on a new technical stack, and the simplicity to have already acquired the culture and tools of 
the company.

Also the **remote work is not adapted for all employees**, it depends on the mindset and the wish of the employee. Some people like to work 
at office and keep physical boundaries between the work and the private life location. Other people like to adapt their private life to break 
the traditional working hours in order to have some extra-professional activities, or avoid the crowd during the rush hours.

# Remote work for employee and employer

The remote work is not a way to save money relates to the traditional work in a physical office. The cost of rent of the office and 
other materials are just re-distributed to other requirements for a good remote work organisation. The goal of the remote work is to 
improve the productivity of the worker, and the rentability of the company, not to reduce the costs of the company. 
If you set up the telework for your company, it should be only for a **WIN-WIN for both employer and employee**.

## Remote work program

If your company had not the culture of the remote working, each activity of the company should be reviewed to be adapted for the remote work:
social events, brainstorm, training, meetings, daily work, presentation. The rules work are different. A remote work program should be fixed,
that contains all new rules and the frame for everything be transparent for the employee and the employer.

Before having the remote work program, the worker should be trained to tools for the remote work, and have the accompaniment to have a sufficient
autonomy to lead her/his missions and fill in her/his objectives.

## Recruitment

The remote work is the opportunity for the recruiter to large the applicants panel, a job offer is available for more of profiles. That is
to say the competition to have a good job is higher, the applicant has more competitors than a traditional job, but also he has more the
choice to find a good job. The exigence in terms of skills and matching for the job are higher. A great worker is great remote worker.
Also an experienced worker could stay in the company even if a life event constraints him to move out. It is certainly the point where 
the remote work is the most interesting. So the turn over for your company could be reduced. But the trap is to hire mercenaries without
a common company culture, the patchwork of employees should be consolidated but remains coherent. The try period takes all its meaning here,
for example a remunenere project of 2 weeks is a good way to finalize the hire of the employee.

## Work space

The remote work space could be seen as a way to reduce costs for a employer, but it should not. In fact, the unique advantage is to pass from a economy
where you have a fix cost to rent a surface (with a waste if the surface is not adapted) to a variable cost where you pay exactly what you should
for each employee. The remote work has a entry cost is more accessible for a startup. The money saves is only by the change of 
cost model for your office. 

The money saves here should be redistributed to reinforce your social cohesion between each employee but physical or virtual company events.

## Work time

For the employee, the work time is saved no need to commute each day. He can save each day for other occupation more interesting that 
the transport. But the employer could be untrust: how to know if the employee works each day? If is she/he joinable and answer enough quickly to each 
solicitation? In fact normally all these questions should be fixed by the remote program, and the employee should respect common rules without
being surveyed every time. Only these rules and his objectives should drive her/his remote work, neither more nor less.

## Work organisation

Of course the organization of the remote work is very different than a physical work. Now the most companies have offices with open spaces where
each employee is alone in a crowd with a lot of interruptions and switching contexts. In reality, the remote work is the passage from a synchronous
organization to an asynchronous organisation. Of course synchronization points are important, and should be done regularly, but each remote worker
is autonomous to have a buffer of tasks filled asynchronously, and is free to choose the priority of each task until the next synchronization point
with his/her manager. In a physical office it should already be the case, but it is accented with the remote work. 

Brainstorm and meeting more hard to consumer of energy for the remote worker. More focus on standalone tasks.
Distraction at home or at coworking office are different than at a office common no dependant children at home.

# Conclusion

To conclude, I am persuaded that the remote work will continue to take market shares to office work in the future,
for this sector of the engineering and the job of software engineer at large, the context of Covid-19 pandemic is just a catalyst. 
This period of forced telework allowed some companies to understand the **benefits** and the **limits** of 
the **remote work** for the employee and for the employer. The remote working plan organized by the tech companies
will exist at least partially even after the Covid-19 pandemic, the event is like a trace with a hot iron to make a tattoo
with its pros and its cons. You cannot forget it, it depends if you like the shape of the tattoo or not.
Perhaps, you did not choose neither to have it and or its shape. But it is here like a perpetual reminder,
and it is a part of you now, that you wanted it or not.

  I explored all the different tech aspects from hardware to software through ecosystems in <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/startup.png" alt="startup">
  <b>start-up and <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/multinational-company.png" alt="multinational-company"> multinational organization

  Before I worked as <span class="notranslate"> software reliability engineer</span> and <span class="notranslate"> web full stack developer</span>.
  After advanced studies in engineering and research and these accumulated professional experiences,
  I acquired soft and hard  skills in

  Here my <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/stack.png" alt="stack"> <b>technical stack</b>,
  that is to say, some technologies that I have already used. It is non-exhaustive, new technologies occur and disappear over time, and the list continues to
  increase, and I use only some of them in the function of the project on which I work:

  I love coding algorithms or/and doing applied mathematics. I am passionate about computer science and data science,
  and more generally about informatics and mathematics. My favorite programming languages, among those I use, are:

  I started my education in <b><img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/applied-mathematics.png" alt="applied-mathematics"> applied mathematics and statistics</b>,
  developed <b>üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è hacking skills</b>, then explored the different <b>üìä domain expertises</b>.
  Now, I am mixing and practicing all these skills. These competencies allow browsing in each job position and role: software (hardware) engineer, machine learning engineer,
  data scientist, data analyst, business intelligence engineer, data engineer, entrepreneur and researcher
  required to develop a project of data science, where the <b>:clipboard: researcher and :computer: software engineer</b> plays an essential role: the first one is in advance
  to the industry providing the potential applied and fundamental theory for the <b>:rocket: future</b> and the second one is a <b>üß¨ generic position</b>
  to be transverse, existing before these specializations. While data analyst, entrepreneur and business intelligence engineer are more linked <b>:dollar: financial aspects</b>,
  and are among the business stakeholders.

  before I worked as <span class="notranslate"> software reliability engineer</span> and <span class="notranslate"> web full stack developer</span>. So, I explored all the different tech aspects from hardware to software

  After advanced studies in engineering and research and these accumulated professional experiences,
  I acquired soft and hard  skills in

  Here my <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/stack.png" alt="stack"> <b>technical stack</b>,
  that is to say, some technologies that I have already used. It is non-exhaustive, new technologies occur and disappear over time, and the list continues to
  increase, and I use only some of them in the function of the project on which I work:

  I love coding algorithms or/and doing applied mathematics. I am passionate about computer science and data science,
  and more generally about informatics and mathematics. My favorite programming languages, among those I use, are:

  One of my preferred formulae is the Euler's identity:

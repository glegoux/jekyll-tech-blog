  After advanced studies for engineering and research with a specialization in the information systems, machine learning and big data, and these accumulated professional experiences,
  I acquired a soft and hard  skills in

    that is to say some technologies that I have already used. It is non-exhaustive, new technologies occurs and disappears over time, and the list continues to

  I love coding algorithms or/and doing applied mathematics. I am passionate about the computer science and data science,
  and more generally about informatics and mathematics. My favorite programming languages, among those I use, are:

<p style="text-align: center">
  Java <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/java.png" alt="java"> |

<p>
  One of my preferred formulae is the Euler's identity:

  Else, I like :rugby_football: rugby, :soccer: soccer, <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/mtga.png" alt="mtga">

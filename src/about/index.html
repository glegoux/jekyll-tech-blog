    that I have could encounter about <b>computer science</b> and <b>applied mathematics</b>.
    In addition to writing articles, I developed this blog as an

    you can either re-use it as a template for your blog or contribute to it. The external resources of the published articles
    are available <a class="underline link-strong" href="https://github.com/glegoux/articles-glegoux-com">here</a>.
    Also, I write blog posts on Medium <a class="underline link-strong" href="https://medium.com/@glegoux">https://medium.com/@glegoux</a>.

    The logo of this blog is composed of a <b>buffer logic gate</b> and <b>uppercase sigma</b> to represent respectively the relation between computer science and applied mathematics.
    They are 2 basic components each one in its respective domain, the buffer to regenerate an input to increase the propagation delay of an unchanged signal and the sigma to sum the inputs.
    This relation symbolizes the will to increase, clarify and summarize the knowledge about these two topics by taking into account their interactions from one to another and reciprocally.

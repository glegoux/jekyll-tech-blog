    I created this blog to share my <b>knowledge</b> and <b>experiences</b> with you
    <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/smiley.png" alt="smiley">, around <b>challenges</b>
    that I have could encounter about <b>computer science</b> and <b>applied mathematics</b>.
    In addition to writing articles, I developed this blog as an
    <a class="underline link-strong" href="https://github.com/glegoux/glegoux.github.io">open source project</a>

    Briefly, I am a <b class="notranslate">software engineer</b> at large. I love coding algorithms or/and doing
    applied mathematics. I worked as <span class="notranslate"> web full stack developer</span>
    <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/web-icon.png" alt="web-icon"> and
    <span class="notranslate"> software reliability engineer</span>
    <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/infra.png" alt="infra">.
    I have had several professional experiences by working successively in a <b>start-up</b> and
    in a <b>multinational organization</b>. I am very excited by the start-up company world
    <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/startup.png" alt="startup"> and the process of creation.
    I am passionate about the computer science and the data science
    <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/data-science.png" alt="data-science">, and more generally about
    <b>informatics and mathematics</b>. One of my preferred formulae is the Euler's identity:
    <span class="notranslate"> $ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $ </span>. My favorite programming languages are
    Java <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/java.png" alt="java">,
    Scala <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/scala.png" alt="scala">,
    Python <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/python.png" alt="python">, and
    Bash <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/bash.png" alt="bash">.
     I am a Linux user <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/linux.png" alt="linux">
     using mainly Ubuntu <img width="25" height="25" src="/_static/common/img/ubuntu.png" alt="ubuntu"> for the development.

      Here my <b>technical stack</b>, that is to say some technologies that I have already used. It is non-exhaustive, new technologies occurs and disappears over time, and the list continues to increase,
      and I use only some of them in function of the project on which I work:

    The logo of this blog is composed of a <b>buffer logic gate</b> and <b>uppercase sigma</b> to represent respectively the relation between computer science and applied mathematics.
    They are 2 basic components each one in its respective domain, the buffer to regenerate an input to increase the propagation delay of an unchanged signal and the sigma to sum the inputs.
    This relation symbolizes the will to increase, clarify and summarize the knowledge about these two topics by taking into account their interactions from one to another and reciprocally.

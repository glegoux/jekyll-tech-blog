`apt-key` is deprecated from Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) for security flaws: don’t use it anymore whatever your Linux environment.
Instead of using it, consider the command gpg now. Then move your public keys relative to your APT package manager to a 
new location with the binary format OpenPGP, and specify the option Signed-By (signed-by) for all your used package repositories.

Let’s follow this plan together to properly use your secure package management and see if you are not infected by these security flaws:

-   🔒Understand the security flaws
-   💡 Explore its workstation environment for  `apt`  and  `apt-key`
-   🔨 Use directly the  `gpg`  command to manage your new keys
-   ➡️ Migrate your current trusted public security keys to the correct format and location
-   ✅ Check the migration and stop the use`apt-key`,  `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg`,  `/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/`
-   ❔Questions
-   🚀 Go further

# 🔒 Understand the security flaws

`apt-key`  is a sub-command of  `apt`  to secure the management packages with asymmetric  security keys. As you know, package management is a sensible area for security; it is an access door for an attacker to install malicious packages. That’s why when a package is installed, cryptography is used to validate that the installed package is really the one wishes (see  [Debian Wiki: SecureApt](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt)).

Here are the milestones of the lifecycle of a package until be installed:

1.  The package is produced on a build machine;
2.  The package is signed on the build machine with a private key;
3.  The signed package is uploaded to a repository (download mirror);
4.  The client system downloads the package (with its package dependencies before, if needed) thanks to the metadata and the usage of its package manager from an authorized repository (or from cache);
5.  The signature of the package is verified (with its package dependencies before, if needed) with the associated public key;
6.  If the signature is valid, the package is installed.

The developers of Debian and Ubuntu realized that the apt-key command has had flaws for a long time (see  [Security tracker: package apt](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/apt)  and particularly  [CVE-2011–3374](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3374)). While  `apt-key`  was not guaranteed to work people continue to use it, that’s why now this command line has been marked as deprecated (see  [Fully deprecate apt-key, schedule removal for Q2/2022 (ee284d59) · Commits · APT Developers / apt · GitLab](https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt/-/commit/ee284d5917d09649b68ff1632d44e892f290c52f)) and will be deleted. Support for the function ends with Debian 11 (Bullseye) and Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish).

The problem is to move all tech ecosystems because numerous documentation or blog posts are not up-to-date on this aspect. Even tech giants like [Google: Linux Software Repositories](https://web.archive.org/web/20230821043842/https://www.google.com/linuxrepositories/), where the usage of `apt-key` is still referenced in August 2023 (after the publication of this article in July 2023). After raising the alert, the correction was made in February 2024 ([here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240219051925/http://www.google.com/linuxrepositories/)).

Let’s understand an attack scenario among several possible ones. Even if, by default, APT checks the validity of the signature of each package to install, and if it is invalid, a warning message is printed, and the package is not installed, this is not sufficient because APT also needs to know which trusted public GPG key belongs to which package repository.

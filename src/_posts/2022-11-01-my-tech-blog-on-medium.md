I will continue writing blog posts here, but they will mainly be published on Medium under the user [@glegoux](https://medium.com/@glegoux). The goal is always to improve the experience of readers and my experience of writing. After having re-evaluated the market of online editors, the Medium platform is mature and becoming more and more popular, being one of the leaders among the editors of tech blogs now. It provides a full WYSIWYG user interface when editing online, with various formatting options provided as the user edits. It allows publishing blog posts (called stories) to capture large audiences and communities.

With the evolution of the practices and tools of online blogging these last few years, I wanted to cross thresholds in my tech writer experience: be more efficient and effective in writing content and gain more visibility by publishing content. It requires allocating less time to maintaining editor tools and more time to write and publish content on other websites than here. So, I needed to choose between continuing to use only this blog, starting to use only Medium, using both, or something else. I chose to use both:

* The most of blog posts will be published on Medium first, with always a partial version here (or inversely)
* The other ones will remain only in this blog.

After evaluating and testing Medium, here are the pros and cons of using Medium vs. my blog:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr class="text-center">
      <th>‚úÖ Pros</th>
      <th>‚ùå Cons</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top;">
‚Ä¢ Medium editor is quicker and handier in updating a post with simple assets like text and images, more intuitive than YAFIYGI, and with instant updates without delay during the deployment of new content like with Jekyll used for my blog<br>
‚Ä¢ Medium has advanced features of collaboration with co-writers, claps, peer comments, and followers, not all available on my blog natively and smoothly<br>
‚Ä¢ Medium decorates the post with an auto-estimation of reading, no need to fill manually, and an auto-listen generation not available on my blog natively<br>
‚Ä¢ Medium offers stats with custom metrics (reads, etc.) for each story more relevant than using a third-party solution like Google Analytics used on my blog
    </td>
    <td style="vertical-align: top;">
‚Ä¢ Medium has partial propriety of the written content and limits the number of readings for non-members, while my blog is free and unlimited open<br>
‚Ä¢ The Medium content has a pre-defined style of design. It is not highly customizable like the content on my blog<br>
‚Ä¢ The Medium features remain less advanced in pushing varied content like dynamic technical diagrams and mathematics formulae. While some workarounds exist, my blog allows it
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For all these reasons, the right choice is a consensus by keeping the best of these 2 worlds. Also, I prefer remaining independent for the long term,
and <https://glegoux.com> is not only a tech blog but a hub of centralized online activities.

Don't worry. I will keep maintaining this website and the open-source template behind it. To avoid breaking changes, the past blog posts will remain accessible without breaking their web links.

However, it seems time-consuming to synchronize the content between Medium and this blog bi-directionally. I can export and import a blog post to and from Medium by copying/pasting the content manually and by adapting the past content. Because the automatic Medium feature for external synchronization has been closed, and no other mature tools allow it, the custom extension of Mardown used here forces potential adaptations. So, the synchronization in updating a blog post from Medium becomes a nightmare to maintain. In contrast, I want to use Medium editor more, which is quicker and more handy to publish followed content. So, as I explained, some complete articles will only be on Medium or exclusively on this blog (with often a second partial version). When I want to have one blog post at both locations, instead of having a full post everywhere, I will use bidirectional web links cross-websites between the partial post and full post (to avoid divergences and too heavy maintenance in case of multiple evolutive versions with there are editions after the original publication).

üôè Thanks for your understanding and your readings.

I will continue writing blog posts here, but mainly they will be published on Medium. The goal will be always to improve the experience of readers and my experience of writing. The Medium platform is mature, then more and more popular becoming one of the leaders in the market of editor online tech blogs. It provides a full WYSIWYG user interface when editing online, with various options for formatting provided as the user edits. It allows publishing blog posts, called stories, to capture a larger audience and community.

With the evolution of practices and tools, I wanted to overcome a gap in my tech writer experience. Be more efficient and effective in writing content by allocating less time to maintain tools to write content. So, I needed to make the choice between using only this blog, using only Medium, using both, or something else. I chose to use both ones. The top and popular blog posts will be on Medium in priority to gain visibility and the other ones on this blog. After evaluating the market of editors for tech blogs, and testing Medium, here were my pros and cons of using Medium:

❎ Pros:  
* Medium editor being quicker and handy in updating a post with simple assets like text and images  
* Medium allows more intuitive and advanced collaborations with co-writers and readers with claps and comments on the file on GitHub and Disqus  

❌ Cons:  
* Medium remains less advanced in pushing varied content like dynamic technical diagrams, and mathematics formulae while some workarounds exist.  
* Medium has a part of the property of the written content

I am going to maintain this website, but less on the blog posts session. The past blog posts will remain accessible without broken web links. Because, I prefer remaining independent for the long term, and also `glegoux.com` is not only a blog but a hub of centralized content and my used online platforms.

However, it seems difficult to synchronize bi-directionally the content between the Medium account and this blog in terms of blog posts, and content of each blog post. I can import a post to Medium, but exporting from Medium to the format is manual, long, and tedious. The synchronization in case of the update of a blog post becomes a nightmare. I am going to maintain the best possible coherence and discovery between the 2 platforms. I expect some divergences, as I said some articles will be only on Medium, and other ones only on this blog. But if an article is present in 2 locations, I will use bidirectional web links between them.

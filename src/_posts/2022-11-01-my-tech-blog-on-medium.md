I will continue writing blog posts here, but mainly they will be published on Medium. The goal will be always to improve the experience of readers and my experience of writings. The Medium platform is mature, then more and more popular becoming one of leaders on the market of editor online tech blogs. It provides a full WYSIWYG user interface when editing online, with various options for formatting provided as the user edits. It allows publishing blog posts, called stories, to capture a larger audience and community.

With the evoluation of practices and tools, I wnanted to overcome a gap in my tech writer experience. Be more efficient and effective to write content against allocated less time to maintain tools to write content. So, I needed to make the choice between using only this blog, using only Medium, using both or something else. I chose to use both ones. The top and popular blog posts will be on Medium in priority to gain visibility, the other ones on this blog. After evaluating the market of editor for the tech blogs, and testing Medium, here were my pros and cons to use Medium:

❎ Pros:  
* Medium editor being quicker and handy in updating a post with simple assets like text and images  
* Medium allows more intuitive and advanced collaborations with co-writers and readers with claps and comments on the than file on GitHub and Disqus  

❌ Cons:  
* Medium remains less advanced in pushing varied content like dynamic technical diagrams, and mathematics formulae while some workarounds exists.  
* Medium has a part of the property of the written content

I am going to maintain this website, but less on the blog posts session. The past blog posts will remain accesible without broken web links. Because, I prefer remaining independant for long term, and also `glegoux.com` is not only a blog, but a hub of centralize content and my used online platforms.

However, it seems difficult to synchronize bi-directionally the content between the Medium account and this blog in terms of blog posts, and content of each blog post. I can import a post to Medium, but export from Medium to the format is manual, long and tedious. The synchronize in case of the update of blog post becomes a nightmare. I am going to maintain the best possible coherence and discovery between the 2 platforms. I expect some divergences, as I said some articles will be only on Medium, and other ones only one this blog. But if an article is present on 2 locations, I will use bidirectional web links between them.
